# Forgot Password Implementation Report

**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Phase:** Phase 0 - Auth And Onboarding
**Status:** Complete

## What Was Implemented

### Shared `ForgotPasswordModal` component

**`src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordModal.tsx`** — new shared component.

Props: `visible: boolean`, `onDismiss: () => void`.

**Input state:**

- Single identifier input accepting phone or email (no toggle, no priority)
- Submit disabled when input is empty
- Loading state during lookup

**Result state (replaces input after submission):**

- Success: blue-tinted message block
  - Phone input → "We sent recovery instructions to your phone."
  - Email input → "We sent recovery instructions to your email."
- Failure: red-tinted message block
  - "We could not find an account with that phone or email."
- Done/Close button to dismiss

**Detection logic:** `value.includes("@")` → email, otherwise phone. Simple and sufficient for prototype.

**Lookup logic:** reads `AuthStore` directly via `readAuthStore()`, searches `accounts[]` by phone exact match or email case-insensitive match. No side effects — purely reads local data.

**Reset behavior:** `useEffect` resets `identifier`, `result`, and `submitting` each time `visible` flips to `true`. Modal is always fresh when reopened.

### Sign In integration

**`src/app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`** — minimal change:

- Added `forgotPasswordVisible` state
- "Forgot password?" `Pressable` now calls `setForgotPasswordVisible(true)` instead of `router.push("/forgot-password")`
- `<ForgotPasswordModal>` mounted at end of screen render

### Sign Up integration

**`src/app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx`** — minimal change:

- Added `forgotPasswordVisible` state
- "Go to Forgot Password →" tap target (shown on duplicate-phone error) now calls `setForgotPasswordVisible(true)` instead of `router.push("/forgot-password")`
- `<ForgotPasswordModal>` mounted at end of screen render

### Route cleanup

**`src/app/(auth)/forgot-password.tsx`** — replaced with `<Redirect href="/sign-in" />`. The route is retained so any direct navigation (e.g. deep link) doesn't 404, but the real flow is the shared modal.

## What Was Deferred

- Real recovery transport (OTP, email delivery, SMS)
- Password reset screen and token validation
- Backend-backed rate limiting
- Error handling for `readAuthStore` failures (tolerated silently in prototype)

## Changed Files

| File                                          | Change                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordModal.tsx` | Created — shared modal component     |
| `src/app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`                  | Wired modal, replaced `router.push`  |
| `src/app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx`                  | Wired modal, replaced `router.push`  |
| `src/app/(auth)/forgot-password.tsx`          | Replaced with redirect to `/sign-in` |

## Completion Status

All MVP acceptance criteria met:

- ✓ Modal opens from Sign In ("Forgot password?" link)
- ✓ Modal opens from Sign Up duplicate-phone error path
- ✓ Single identifier input, phone or email
- ✓ Local account lookup via `readAuthStore`
- ✓ Success only when identifier exists
- ✓ Phone vs email success messages are correct
- ✓ Failure message when identifier not found
- ✓ Modal resets state on each open
- ✓ TypeScript passes
